第一章

1 -- Give them the current state of whatever you topic is.

告诉他们你所讨论的话题的现状。

E.g. If you're writing about fat loss then tell them some statistics
about how 90% of Americans are overweight.

例如：如果你在写关于减肥的文章，那就告诉他们90%的美国人是如何超重的。

2 -- Tell them a little bit of history of your industry. What happened
before the big change? Why are we in this current state?

告诉他们你这个行业的一些历史。大变化之前发生了什么？为什么我们现在这样？

3 -- Tell them the BAD NEWS

告诉他们坏消息

E.g. Again, if you are writing about fat loss, tell them that it's
actually getting worse.

例如：再一次，如果你在写关于脂肪流失的文章，告诉他们它实际上正在变得更糟。

4 -- Tell them who WIN'S and who LOSES in the big shift that is
happening.

告诉他们谁赢了谁输了正在发生的大转变。

E.g. Continuing the fat loss example, tell them how a group of people
are starting a revolution against junk food (the winners) and how those
who are not adapting fast enough (the losers) are going to continue to
gain weight and possibly die early.

例如：继续这个减肥的例子，告诉他们一群人是如何开始一场反对垃圾食品的革命的(优胜者)，以及那些没有适应足够快的人(失败者)将如何继续增加体重并可能过早死亡。

5 -- Tell them the GOOD NEWS

告诉他们好消息

If there's bad news, then there's also good news. Ask them to join the
WINNERS if they want to solve their problems, achieve success -- or get
whatever results they want to get.

如果有坏消息，也有好消息。如果他们想解决他们的问题，取得成功，或者取得他们想要的任何结果，请他们加入优胜者。
