There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. We try to work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

有一种叫做“向后工作”的方法在Amazon中得到了广泛的应用。我们试着从客户那里逆向工作，而不是从一个产品的想法开始，试图把客户栓在上面。虽然向后工作可以应用于任何特定的产品决策，但在开发新产品或特性时，使用这种方法尤其重要。

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

对于新的计划，产品经理通常从编写内部新闻稿开始，宣布成品。新闻稿的目标受众是新/更新产品的客户，这些客户可以是零售客户，也可以是工具或技术的内部用户。内部新闻稿集中于客户问题，当前解决方案(内部或外部)如何失败，以及新产品将如何吹走现有解决方案。

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

如果列出的好处对客户来说听起来并不有趣或令人兴奋，那么也许它们就不是(也不应该建立)。相反，产品经理应该不断地在新闻稿中进行迭代，直到他们得到真正听起来像好处的好处为止。在新闻稿上迭代比在产品本身上迭代要便宜得多(而且更快！)

Here's an example outline for the press release:
Heading - Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
Sub-Heading - Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
Summary - Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
Problem - Describe the problem your product solves.
Solution - Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
Quote from You - A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
How to Get Started - Describe how easy it is to get started.
Customer Quote - Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
Closing and Call to Action - Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

以下是新闻稿的一个示例大纲：标题-以读者(即您的目标客户)理解的方式命名该产品。副标题-描述谁是产品的市场和他们得到什么好处。只有一个句子在标题下面。总结-对产品和效益进行总结。假设读者不会再读任何其他东西，所以要把这一段写得很好。问题-描述你的产品解决的问题。解决方案-描述您的产品如何优雅地解决问题。引用你的话-引用贵公司发言人的话。如何开始-描述它是多么容易开始。客户报价结束并呼吁行动-把它叠起来，给出读者下一步应该去的方向。

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

如果新闻稿超过一页半，可能太长了。保持简单。大多数段落的3-4句话。把脂肪切掉。别把它变成规范。您可以在新闻稿中附带一个常见问题，回答所有其他业务或执行问题，这样新闻稿就可以集中于客户得到的内容。我的经验法则是，如果新闻稿很难写出来，那么这个产品可能会很烂。继续努力，直到每个段落的大纲流出来。

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

哦，我还喜欢为主流消费产品写新闻稿，我称之为“奥普拉-代言人”。想象一下，你坐在奥普拉的沙发上，刚刚向她解释了这个产品，然后当她向她的观众解释时，你听了。那是“奥普拉-说”，而不是“极客-说”。

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).


一旦项目进入开发阶段，新闻稿就可以作为试金石；一盏指导性的灯。产品团队可以问自己：“我们在建立新闻稿中的内容吗？”如果他们发现自己花了很多时间去制作新闻稿中没有的东西(过度建造)，他们需要问自己为什么。这使得产品开发集中于实现客户利益，而不是构建需要更长时间、需要资源来维护和没有提供真正的客户利益(至少不足以保证包含在新闻稿中)的无关的东西。
